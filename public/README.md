# Ember Tooling Organisation

</div>

Welcome to the Ember Tooling organization! We are a community-driven organization dedicated to enhancing and facilitating the development experience within the Ember ecosystem through robust tooling integration. Our mission is to create and maintain tools that improve the efficiency, enjoyability, and overall workflow of developing Ember.js applications.

## âœ¨ Our Projects

### [Ember Language Server](https://github.com/ember-tooling/ember-language-server)

The Ember Language Server (ELS) is a Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation specifically tailored for Ember.js projects. It provides advanced features such as autocomplete, go to definition, and real-time linting, making it easier for developers to work within the Ember ecosystem efficiently.

### [VSCode Ember](https://github.com/ember-tooling/vscode-ember)

VSCode Ember is the Visual Studio Code client for the Ember Language Server. It integrates seamlessly with VSCode, bringing the power of ELS to one of the most popular code editors available today. With this extension, developers can enjoy a rich Ember.js development experience right within VSCode.

### [VSCode Ember Pack](https://github.com/ember-tooling/vscode-ember-pack)

The VSCode Ember Pack is an extension pack for Visual Studio Code that bundles all the necessary extensions for Ember.js development. It includes the VSCode Ember extension, among others, providing developers with a comprehensive set of tools to kickstart their Ember.js projects in VSCode with ease.
